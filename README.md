My name is Anastasiia and I live in the USA. 
I have always been very curious and goal-oriented. 
I have lived in Russia and China, I am familiar with different cultures, traditions and languages. The experience of living in different countries allows me to easily adapt to different conditions, understand and accept different people and become better myself.

I have work experience in IT company, I also have experience teaching Chinese. 
In a new country for me, I decided to try my hand at testing and I fell in love with this business.

I am very meticulous about the details, very attentive and love monotonous work. I found a lot of similarities in Chinese characters and testing, both of these areas require a lot of inclusion, attentiveness, patience and picky about details.
I understand that in my future work I will have to learn new things and I am ready for this. I understand that I will have to work in a team and I have always been a sociable, kind person with leadership qualities.

As part of my graduation project, I had the opportunity to test a web service for renting scooters, also test mobile application and API testing. So, I have knowledge and experience in:
- Working experience in requirements analysis, test design, functional and non-functional testing, creating Mindmap, writing bug reports
- UI Testing
- Knowledge of all phases of Agile and Waterfall models.
- API (Postman)
- SQL
- Proxyman/Charles
- Git and GitHub knowledge.

I will be glad for any feedback.  This will help me a lot in my search.
